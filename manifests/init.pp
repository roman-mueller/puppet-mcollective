# Class: mcollective
#
# This class provides a simple way to deploy MCollective nodes and clients.
# It will install and configure the necessary packages.
#
# This module supports generic STOMP and RabbitMQ connectors,
# with optional SSL support.
#
# It supports PSK and SSL as authentication methods.
#
# Parameters:
#   ['node']              - Whether to install an MCollective node.
#                           Defaults to true.
#   ['client']            - Whether to install an MCollective client.
#                           Defaults to false.

#   ['security_ssl_client_private'] - If SSL is used, the path to the SSL
#                                     private client key.
